OpenSUSE builds against the built JSS aren't working.
Only builds against the system jss work and some manual
adjustments are needed.
 
As stated in systemjssMakefile change
 
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${librarypath4fedora}
 export CLASSPATH=${classpath4fedora}
  
 to

 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${librarypath4opensuse}
 export CLASSPATH=${classpath4opensuse}

 These are meant to be strictly local changes.
